To find the binary values for the sign s, the exponent e, and the fractional mantissa f of the given 32-bit single-precision floating-point number:

Sign (s):

The sign bit is located at bit position 31 (leftmost bit).
From the given number, the sign bit value is 0.
Therefore, the binary value for the sign (s) is 0.
Exponent (e):

The exponent bits are located at bit positions 30 to 23.
From the given number, the exponent bits are 00001110.
Since the bias is 127 for single-precision floating-point numbers, we need to subtract the bias from the actual value to get the exponent.
Calculating the decimal value of 00001110, which is 14, then subtracting the bias (127) gives us the actual exponent value: 14 - 127 = -113.
Converting -113 to binary, we get 10001111.
Therefore, the binary value for the exponent (e) is 10001111.
Fractional Mantissa (f):

The fractional mantissa bits are located at bit positions 22 to 0.
From the given number, the fractional mantissa bits are 10100000000000000000000.
Therefore, the binary value for the fractional mantissa (f) is 10100000000000000000000.
Hence, the binary values for the sign s, the exponent e, and the fractional mantissa f are 0, 10001111, and 10100000000000000000000, respectively.
