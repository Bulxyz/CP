a) For double-precision floating-point numbers (floats) in Python, the underflow and overflow limits in decimal are as follows:


Underflow occurs when the number is too small to be represented accurately. In Python, the underflow limit for double-precision floating-point numbers is approximately 2.2250738585072014e-308.


Overflow occurs when the number is too large to be represented accurately. In Python, the overflow limit for double-precision floating-point numbers is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308.


b) For double-precision floating-point numbers (doubles) in Python, the underflow and overflow limits in decimal are as follows:


Underflow occurs when the number is too small to be represented accurately. In Python, the underflow limit for double-precision floating-point numbers is approximately 4.9406564584124654e-324.


Overflow occurs when the number is too large to be represented accurately. In Python, the overflow limit for double-precision floating-point numbers is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308.
