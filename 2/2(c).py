Sign bit (s = 0): Positive number




Exponent bits (e = 00001110):



Convert to decimal: 00001110 = 14

Exponent = 14 - bias (bias is usually 127 for single-precision floating-point format)




Fraction bits (f = 101000000000000000000000):



Convert to decimal: 101000000000000000000000 = 1.625 in decimal




Now, let's calculate the value represented by these bits:



Value = (-1)^0 2^(14 - bias) 1.625


Assuming the bias is 127 (for single-precision floating point):



Value = 1 2^(14 - 127) 1.625

Value = 1 2^(-113) 1.625

Value = 1 (1/2^113) 1.625

Value = 1.625 / 2^113


Therefore, the mantissa of A equals 1.625 in binary form, represented by the given bits for s, e, and f in the IEEE 754 floating-point format.
