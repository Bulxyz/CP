To determine the full value of A based on the provided bit positions and values:



For s (bit positions 31), the value is 0.

For e (bit positions 30 to 23), the value is 0000 1110.

For f (bit positions 22 to 0), the value is 1010 0000 0000 0000 0000 000.


Now, let's combine these values to determine the full value of A:


A = 0 0000 1110 1010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 000


Therefore, the full value of A is 00001110101000000000000000000000 in binary.
